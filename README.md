# JohanKit

**JohanKit** is a developer-friendly CLI designed to supercharge your **vibe-coding** flow. It helps you capture, restore, and manipulate snapshots of your codebase, making it effortless to experiment, refactor, and collaborate—without locking you into a specific framework or workflow.

Think of it as your personal **code snapshot toolkit**: lightweight, fast, and platform-agnostic.

## Features

### 📸 copy
Take a snapshot of files in a directory and copy it to your clipboard as a JSON array.
```bash
johankit copy <dir> [exts]
```
* `dir`: Directory to scan (default: current)
* `exts`: Comma-separated list of extensions (e.g., `ts,js`)

### 📋 paste
Restore files or apply patches from a JSON snapshot stored in your clipboard.
```bash
johankit paste [dir] [--run] [--diff] [--dry-run]
```
* `--run`: Execute console commands included in the patch.
* `--diff`: Interactive mode. Shows a line-by-line diff and asks for confirmation before applying changes to each file.
* `--dry-run`: Preview changes without modifying any files.
* `-y`: Auto-accept all prompts.

### 🤖 prompt
Generate a ready-to-use AI prompt containing your codebase snapshot and your instructions.
```bash
johankit prompt <dir> "<user request>"
```
* `dir`: Directory to include in the context.
* `<user request>`: Instructions for the AI to perform on the codebase.

### 🔄 sync
Two-way synchronization: copies the current snapshot, waits for your AI-generated patch input via terminal (Ctrl+D to finish), applies it, and copies the updated snapshot back to the clipboard.
```bash
johankit sync [dir] [--run] [--dry-run]
```

## Example Workflow

1. **Prepare Context**: `johankit prompt src "Add input validation to all API routes"`
2. **Get AI Response**: Copy the JSON patch array generated by your favorite LLM.
3. **Review & Apply**: `johankit paste --diff`

---

## Configuration

Customize ignored patterns by creating a `johankit.yaml` or `johankit.yml` in your project root:

```yaml
ignore:
  - dist
  - node_modules
  - .git
  - custom-build-folder
```

JohanKit also automatically respects patterns found in your `.gitignore` file.

## Requirements

* Node.js >= 14
* Clipboard-compatible OS (`pbcopy`, `xclip`, or Windows `clip`)

## Installation

```bash
npm install -g johankit
